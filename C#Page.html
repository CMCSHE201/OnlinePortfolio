            <h1>Monumental</h1>
            <p>'Monumental' was a project I worked on in my third year of university.
            <br/>The aim of the project was to create an application that utilized AR technology to create a fun experience.
            <br/>As a team we decided the application would be used to take the user around a tour of Glasgow City and explore the multiple famous monuments found within the city.
            <br/>These monuments included George Square, the Duke of Wellington Statue and more.
            <br/>To provide more incentive for users to use the application, when they would reach the monument, they would be able to partake in a minigame which would allow them to 'collect' the monument.
            <br/>Once the user has collected the monument, they would be given some background on that particular monument which would help users learn more about the city.
            <br/>They would also have that monument stored in their gallery, this can be viewed at any time and would let the user revise the background on the monument or replay the minigame again. </p>
